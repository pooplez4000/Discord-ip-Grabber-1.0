Hello, this is your step brother speaking and well thankyou for downloading my IP grabber. Here are the instructions, make sure you have JSON,and DHOOKS installed to run this prograhm. DISCLAIMER I DO NOT RECOMEND MESSING WITH PEOPLE WITH BETTER BOOTERS OR MORE EXPIRENCE THEN YOU (unless you are very experienced your self, which then why whould you be using this exactly?) CAUSE THEY HAVE THE POWER TO FRY YOUR ROUTOR (and you dont whant that do you now) SO WHEN DOING THIS PLEASE HAVE A VPN ON THANKYOU. How to use the grabber simply open the code in python idle then where it says INSERT-WEBHOOK-HERE:) replace that with your webhook i will have a toutorile for both installing json and dhooks and making a webhook right
